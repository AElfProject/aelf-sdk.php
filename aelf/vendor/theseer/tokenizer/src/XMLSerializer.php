     * Identifies which part of the FileDescriptorProto was defined at this
     * location.
     * Each element is a field number or an index.  They form a path from
     * the root FileDescriptorProto to the place where the definition.  For
     * example, this path:
     *   [ 4, 3, 2, 7, 1 ]
     * refers to:
     *   file.message_type(3)  // 4, 3
     *       .field(7)         // 2, 7
     *       .name()           // 1
     * This is because FileDescriptorProto.message_type has field number 4:
     *   repeated DescriptorProto message_type = 4;
     * and DescriptorProto.field has field number 2:
     *   repeated FieldDescriptorProto field = 2;
     * and FieldDescriptorProto.name has field number 1:
     *   optional string name = 1;
     * Thus, the above path gives the location of a field name.  If we removed
     * the last element:
     *   [ 4, 3, 2, 7 ]
     * this path refers to the whole field declaration (from the beginning
     * of the label to the terminating semicolon).
